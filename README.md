# OOP-Inheritance.

1. Multilevel Inheritance :

In multilevel inheritance,this is where features of the base class and the derived class 
are further inherited into the new derived class.
This is similar to a relationship representing a child and a grandfather.

 2. Hybrid Inheritance.

Hybrid inheritance is a combination of different types of inheritance in object-oriented programming.

Hybrid inheritance combines two or more types of inheritance 
(single, multiple, multilevel, or hierarchical inheritance) to create a more complex class hierarchy.

3. Hierarchical Inheritance.

Hierarchical inheritance is a type of inheritance where multiple derived classes or subclasses 
inherit from a single base class or superclass. 
In this type of inheritance, you have a single parent class (superclass) that serves as the common ancestor 
for multiple child classes (subclasses). 
Each subclass inherits the attributes and behaviors of the superclass, forming a hierarchical structure.
